VoxVulgi Offline Bundle Payload

This folder is optionally bundled into the desktop installer as Tauri "resources".

When present, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` bootstraps the payload into the app-data directory
on first run (local extract; no network).

Expected layout when populated (generated by the offline bundle prep script):
  offline/manifest.json
  offline/payload.zip  (contains tools/, models/, cache/huggingface/)
